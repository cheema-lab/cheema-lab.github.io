As way of background, metabolomics provides a qualitative and quantitative description of small (<1 kD) molecules (metabolites) involved in metabolism and their connected pathways. It encompasses a wide variety of metabolites, including those found naturally in the body, such as glucose or cholesterol, as well those from external sources like diet and environment. Overall, metabolomics offers a snapshot of complex biological systems required for health and perturbed in disease.

At Cheema Lab, the power of metabolomics has already been demonstrated in a variety of disease states including cancer, Alzheimer's, infectiousdisease, alcoholic liver disease, inflammatory conditions including inflammatory bowel diseases, radiation injury, diabetes, transplantation medicine, and many others. Given the multidisciplinary nature of a systems biology approach, metabolomics has direct applicability to numerous fields including molecular biology, cancerbiology, neuroscience, toxicology, nutrition, radiobiology, chemistry, physics, environmental science, mathematics/mathematical-modeling, translational sciences, botany, food and agricultural studies, drug development, personalized medicine, and the microbiome.
